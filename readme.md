# 7 Days To Die AppData backup tool

The purpose of this console app is to create regular backups of your 7 Days To Die AppData to your Desktop each time the game closes.

I wrote this because there is known issues of Save Corruption, this can help those who make experience corruption.

To run just double click before you load 7 Days To Die, the whole app is automated so you shouldn't need to interact with it.

### Notes:
- Depending on how many Game Worlds you have and Save Files, the backups can be large in size
- Backups will be sorted into Date and Time format
- It's the Users responsibility to remove old backups
- I will improve this/apply fixes over time the more I use it

### Requirements:
- Windows x64
- Free Space
- 7 Days To Die Game Installed

### What's New?
- Memory Improvements when running for a long time
- Included a small batch script to open the 7 Days To Die AppData folder
